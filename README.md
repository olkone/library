## About
This library app was created with HTML, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## App Features
* Keep track of your books by entering the title, author, genre, number of pages, and read-status.
* Your saved books can be viewed as cards on the card dashboards.
* Delete any unwanted books.
* Edit your saved books.

## Code Features
*The following features were the main concepts I learned and implemented in this project.*

### HTML & (S)CSS:
* Creating modals
    * toggling display attribute on click
    * z-index
* Form validation
* CSS selectors
* Pseudo elements and classes
* Position attributes

### JavaScript
* JavaScript objects
    * Object constructors
    * Adding, calling, and editing object properties and values
* Arrays
    * adding, indexing, splicing, and editing objects in an array
* Save form data to an object
* Constructing responsive HTML elements with JS

## Improvements and Feature Ideas
* Sort by title, author, genre, etc.
* Tidy user input by trimming white space.
* Optimize for smaller mobile screens.
* View books in a table (print or save.)
* Alert user when they submit a duplicate book.
* Toggle between dark and light mode.
